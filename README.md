# todo-app-full-stack

Deployed using AWS elastic beanstalk with client, tasks_server, and api_gateway deployed separately (no longer live because my free trial ended).
The api_gateway handles authentication and protects all routes going to the tasks_server.
Full stack todo list app built with React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.
